# `r params$name`

This report provides feedback about how you engage in effective negotiation behaviours. It should be a source of reflection on areas where you are performing well, and areas where you can improve. You will also see feedback about three other properties that affect your negotiations: need for closure, need for cognition, and social value orientation. In each section of the report, you can see an explanation of the measure and how you compare with your peers. 

<div class="note-text">
<strong>Note:</strong> For the Negotiation Behaviours Inventory, "MBS Participants" refers to the average score of MBS participants. For the other measures, we do not yet have sufficient data to report on MBS responses, so we are using averages derived from prior research. These benchmarks will be updated during this subject and shared with you.

# Need for Closure assessment

This section shows your responses to the Need for Closure scale, which measures your preference for order, structure, and closure in your thinking and decision-making. It is common to have somewhat high need for closure, but if your score is very high, that might indicate that you face challenges remaining open and keeping negotiations going long enough to maximise value creation---or coming back to re-discuss issues that had been tentatively decided.

### How this relates to negotiation

Your Need for Closure can influence your negotiation style in several ways:

- Higher scores may indicate a preference for reaching agreements quickly, potentially at the expense of exploring all options.
- Lower scores may indicate comfort with ambiguity and willingness to keep options open longer during negotiations.
- Understanding your need for closure can help you recognise when you might be rushing to resolution versus when you might benefit from exploring more options.

# Need for Cognition assessment

This section shows your responses to the Need for Cognition scale, which measures your tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking.

  cat("- **Higher scores** (above 3.5) suggest that you tend to enjoy cognitive challenges and complex problem-solving. You likely prefer to think deeply about issues and are motivated by intellectual engagement.\n\n")
  
  cat("- **Lower scores** (below 3.5) suggest that you may prefer simpler cognitive tasks and might be less inclined to engage in effortful thinking when it's not necessary.\n\n")
}
```
</div>

### How this relates to negotiation

Your Need for Cognition can influence your negotiation approach in several ways:

- A higher Need for Cognition may lead you to analyse negotiation situations more thoroughly, consider more alternatives, and develop more complex negotiation strategies.

- You might enjoy the intellectual challenge of negotiation, including analysing the other party's interests, crafting persuasive arguments, and finding creative solutions that satisfy both parties.

- Understanding your Need for Cognition can help you recognise when you might benefit from more or less cognitive engagement in negotiations, depending on the situation.

# Social Value Orientation (SVO)

Social Value Orientation (SVO) describes how people value outcomes for themselves and others in interdependent situations. Your SVO profile indicates your preferences for allocating resources between yourself and others.

## SVO and negotiation

Your Social Value Orientation has important implications for how you approach negotiations:

- **Competitive** orientations may focus strongly on winning and gaining advantage over others.
- **Individualistic** orientations may focus on maximising personal gain without much concern for the counterpart.
- **Prosocial** orientations tend to look for mutually beneficial outcomes and fair distributions.
- **Altruistic** orientations may prioritise the counterpart's needs, sometimes at personal cost.

Understanding your own orientation can help you recognise when your natural tendencies might help or hinder different types of negotiations. For instance, prosocial orientations may excel in long-term relationship building, while individualistic orientations might serve better in one-time distributive bargaining.

Most people (approximately 60%) are classified as prosocial, while about 30% are individualistic, 5% competitive, and 5% altruistic. Your position relative to these distributions can help you understand your natural tendencies compared to others.
